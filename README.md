## 📊 Project Overview
| **Client** | **Role** | **Tools Used** | **Duration** |
|------------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| A local water delivery utility serving residential and commercial customers in Mumbai | Volunteer Operations & Data Analyst (Pro Bono Consultant) | Microsoft Excel (Advanced Formulas, Power Query, PivotTables), Microsoft Power BI, Data Modeling, Process Mapping | February 2023 – Ongoing |

**Objective:** To design and implement a data-driven operational framework that improves efficiency, reduces costs, enhances customer satisfaction, and identifies growth opportunities.

## 🔍 Initial Assessment & Problem Diagnosis
An initial process audit revealed critical pain points:

- **Scheduling & Routing:** Dispatchers used static paper-based schedules and intuitive routing, leading to inefficient trips, fuel waste, and unreliable delivery windows.
- **Data Management:** Customer records, delivery logs, and billing data existed in separate, inconsistent spreadsheets, causing errors and making reporting a manual, 8-10 hour weekly chore.
- **Financial Operations:** Billing cycles were irregular, and cash flow was difficult to track due to a lack of integrated systems.
- **Strategic Insight:** No mechanism existed to analyze customer segments, predict demand, or identify profitable expansion areas.

## 🛠️ Strategic Approach & Implementation
A phased, data-first methodology was employed to ensure sustainable improvement.

### Phase 1: Foundation – Centralizing Data & Automating Core Processes
**Action:** Designed a unified, relational data model within **Microsoft Excel** using multiple interconnected workbooks and **Power Query** to automate data ingestion from driver sheets and billing inputs.

**Outcome:** Created a single source of truth for all operational data, **improving data accuracy and reducing time to generate core reports by approximately 20%.** This eliminated duplicate entries and reconciliation errors.

### Phase 2: Visibility – Developing Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards
**Action:** Connected the centralized Excel data model to **Microsoft Power BI**. Built interactive executive dashboards displaying live KPIs: On-Time Delivery Rate, Route Efficiency, Revenue Trends, and Customer Payment Status.

**Outcome:** **Eliminated 8-10 hours of manual weekly reporting**, empowering management with self-service analytics. Streamlined billing and cash flow monitoring, significantly improving financial transparency.

### Phase 3: Optimization – Data-Driven Logistics & Scheduling
**Action:** Analyzed historical delivery data (location, time, volume) in Excel to identify clustering patterns and traffic bottlenecks. Developed and implemented optimized delivery routes and a dynamic scheduling template.

**Outcome:** **Reduced fuel consumption and average route time by 10-12%.** This efficiency gain directly enabled a **10-15% improvement in on-time delivery performance.**

### Phase 4: Growth – Predictive Analytics for Strategic Planning
**Action:** Used **Power BI’s analytics capabilities** to segment customers by delivery volume, revenue, and payment behavior. Applied time-series analysis to forecast seasonal demand and map high-potential service areas.

**Outcome:** Provided actionable insights that identified under-served neighborhoods and high-value customer profiles, guiding strategic decisions that led to an **8-10% uplift in revenue.**
